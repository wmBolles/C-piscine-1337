Solve this ex01 you should be learn about file permissions
here is all permissions of files and i hope you read it.

permissions     meaning	      value
r		read	      4
w               write         2
x               execute       1
-               no permission 0

but we have permissions for the user and the group  and other user(if you are in a network)
exemple : -rw-r--r-x file.c
here we have 3 permissions for 3 users : the user has the permission of reading and writing on the file "rw-"
the group have just one permission is reading : "r--"
and the other users have too permissions is ": reading and executing the file "r-x"

to solve the ex01 u need to change the permissions of the file to be like the subject permission file . by execute the following command
chmod 455 testShell00

but u need to create it before that , just use : touch testShell00

you should be change the time and date by using touch command and -ct flag -c : we use it for ignore the creation of another file.
-t : to set the time , but respect this format : [MM/dd/hh/mm.ss] filename.
execute this command : 

touch -ct 06012342 testShell00 

finaly execute the command in the subject :

tar -cf teshShell00.tar testShell00

-c : creation file
-f : make an archive file
